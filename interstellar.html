      <h1>SO WHAT?</h1>
      <p>
        Interstellar is a fantastic movie. It checks every box on my list of requirements. The characters have their flaws and wishes. The acting is emotional and authentic. The script is the foundation of the entire movie.
        Yes, the visuals are striking, but Interstellar is not complete without its dialog, conflict, plot, and subtext. The sound is the cherry on top. The atmospheric music and sound effects belong in every scene and provide an immersive environment.
        To me, Interstellar is not only about space travel, but about absolution and love. Humanity made a mistake and love will fuel sacrifice leading to their absolution. Interstellar is a good illustration of superb cinematic storytelling and grand filmmaking.

        Interstellar is a 2014 sci-fi drama movie, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, and John Lithgow. 
        In a sentence, Interstellar is about a group of explorers who travel through a wormhole to find a planet that can sustain human life. Movies are subjective and mean different things to different people. A movie that I think is great can be a huge disappointment to someone else. A big question when watching any movie is, what makes this movie great? 
        When I watch a movie, I think 5 things are key to evaluating its greatness. I like to look out for characters, acting, script, cinematography, and sound. 
      </p>

        The characters in Interstellar are not too enigmatic or mysterious. Matthew McConaughey plays a straightforward, ambitious man named Cooper. His unassertive father-in-law, meek son, and brilliant daughter live with him on a dying Earth. His ex-supervisor, Professor Brand, is an educated man who persuades Cooper to join the team and pilot the spaceship, the Endurance. 
        The characters have impenetrable chemistry and exert an authentic performance. The characters are there own and don’t borrow from previous films or other adaptations of space exploration movies. Each character has wants, desires, flaws and limitations. There were times I hated the choice a character made because I thought it was selfish or self-serving. But, every character has goals that align with their arcs. 
        The way the actors bring the script to life may be the most important part of storytelling. Evoking emotion is what sticks with a viewer when watching a movie. The amount of times I yelled, cried, and laughed at my TV is what makes this movie one of my favorites. A good example is when Cooper was catching up on the dozens of video calls he missed from his daughter. 
        It was heartbreaking to see how torn up she was about his departure and how torn up he was about leaving. While watching the videos, Cooper completely shuts down and starts crying. 
        It was almost like I was intruding on an intimate moment between father and daughter. In my opinion, those are the best kind of moments to watch. Another example is when Cooper (and the audience) finds out Professor Brand finished the equation a long time ago. 
        The purpose of the mission was not to find a habitable planet to save humanity, but to find a habitable planet to repopulate and start over. To be quite honest, the first time I watched Interstellar I didn’t understand the complexity of the entire movie. 
        But, when watching this scene for the first time, I was in utter shock. I was asking myself, what? How could Professor Brand lie to a man who only cares about his family? Why did Cooper leave in the first place? Why didn’t Cooper STAY? The expression on Cooper’s face and his body language spoke louder than words ever could have.

        Kevin O’Connor from The Ringer said, “Interstellar brought me on an emotional voyage unlike anything I’ve felt before...Its booming sounds and striking images physically enthralled me. The way in which it fused both the fantastical and the familiar mentally captivated me...Interstellar is cinematic magic that brought me to a place that’s hard to reach as you get older: a place of childlike wonder” (Staff).  
        Eliciting the feeling of joy, exhilaration, uneasiness, anger, or heartbreak is what makes a performance authentic. Authenticity is the key to a great movie. It makes me wonder if the actors forget they’re on camera. Emotion is what makes a script alive.
        A good script has conflict, easy dialog, and subtext. The characters struggle and put up a hard fight in the world they’re in. Not one character gives up despite the hardships that may stand in their way.

        Conflict can be a good attribute to the plot because it can end up being a staggering twist. 
        One of my favorite twists is when Mann tells Cooper Plan A was never a foreseeable option and Professor Brand’s plan to strand Earth’s inhabitants and colonize a new planet was.
        The tone of the movie instantly shifts from discovery to survival and urgency. The dialog between characters either alleviate stressful situations or worsen them. A lot of the things Professor Brand, Amelia Brand, and Cooper say are quotable and inspiring. 
        The dialog between them is not oversaturated with scientific talk or terms, so the viewer can comprehend what is being said. 
        Also, Interstellar has themes that are not outright said to the viewer. According to No Film School, “Essentially, subtext is all about the subtle messages you're trying to convey to your audience without explicitly coming out and stating them” (Renée). 
        Subtext decreases the amount of dialog or plot necessary to carry out a storyline or idea. A scene I really enjoy is Amelia Brand’s monologue about love. She says, “Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. 
        Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it” (“Interstellar”).

      <p>
        Interstellar has themes of love, sacrifice, and redemption. Ultimately, Cooper’s love for Murph and his family fuels his sacrifice that leads to humanity’s redemption.
        The visuals of a movie include set, location, lighting, camerawork, and cinematography. The atmosphere on Earth is visually bleak and desert. It perfectly matches the circumstances of Earth’s current environmental state. The atmosphere of space and the Endurance is open, vast, and unknown. 
        The striking visuals including Miller and Mann’s planet, the black hole (Gargantua), Earth, and basically everything captures the viewer’s attention and refuses to let go. 
        A complementary element of visuals is sound. Interstellar is littered with ambient sounds that perfectly capture the tone and mood of the proceeding scene. The sound effects are epic and grand. The music is captivating and beautiful. In some scenes the music is serene in contrast to the excitement on screen. 
        Interstellar would be nothing without its eerie music and ambient sounds.
